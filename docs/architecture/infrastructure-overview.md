# Edge Security

Cerberus uses the CloudFront WAF to provide edge security.  This is automatically setup with the 
[command-line API](../administration-guide/lifecycle-management-cli).

The WAF automatically drops requests with incorrect request body size, SQL injection, and Cross Site Scripting (XSS).

CloudFront access logs are parsed using a <a target="_blank" onclick="trackOutboundLink('https://github.com/Nike-Inc/cerberus-cloudfront-lambda')" href="https://github.com/Nike-Inc/cerberus-cloudfront-lambda">rate limiting lambda</a> 
that automatically blacklists IP addresses exceeding a configurable request rate limit.  The access logs are stored in 
S3 and every time a new log chunk is written to S3, the Lambda is triggered (every 10 minutes or so).

# Routing Requests

A Route 53 CNAME record points to the internet-facing Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) in the VPC. The ELB fronts an 
Auto Scaling Group (ASG) of <a target="_blank" onclick="trackOutboundLink('https://www.nginx.com/')" href="https://www.nginx.com/">NGINX</a> instances and handles reverse proxying of the 
[Cerberus Dashboard](../user-guide/dashboard), [Vault](vault), and the Cerberus Management Service. Only APIs from Vault that are 
required for managing secrets are exposed.

See the [REST API](rest-api) for more detail on how requests are routed.

# Vault and Consul

Consul is the underlying storage for [Vault](vault).

# Cerberus Management Service

The Cerberus Management Service is a microservice that was created to add needed features without modifying the 
Vault project including:

*  Management of Safe Deposit Boxes
*  User Authentication
*  AWS IAM Role Authentication
*  Permissions Management

RDS is used to storing meta data about the SDBs while Vault/Consul are used for storing the actual encrypted secrets.
