[Archaius](https://github.com/Netflix/archaius) is a configuration management library created by Netflix which 
enables dynamic runtime properties from multiple configuration sources such as URLs, JDBC, and Amazon DynamoDB.

The [Cerberus Archaius Client](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/cerberus-archaius-client) enables applications to use
Cerberus as an additional runtime source for properties.

Additional documentation about setup, including how to configure polling for your application, is available in 
the [README](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/cerberus-archaius-client/blob/master/README.md).
