The Cerberus Dashboard is a Self-Service UI for managing secrets.

- Create new safe deposit boxes (SDB) for Applications or Shared secrets
- Modify ownership and access permissions for secrets
- Delete SDBs


# Screenshots

Single sign-on eliminates the need to manually create user accounts.

The Welcome Screen lists the SDBs you have access to and lets you add new ones.

Users can create their own safe deposit boxes for their applications.  Self-service eliminates the need for 
service tickets to administrators.

Users can add [Vault](../architecture/vault) paths for their applications as well as view and modify properties.

# Implementation

The dashboard is implemented as a <a target="_blank" onclick="trackOutboundLink('https://facebook.github.io/react/')" href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> single-page application (SPA) that interacts with the
[composed REST API](../architecture/rest-api).  It is stored in an [S3 bucket](../architecture/infrastructure-overview)
that gets setup using the [lifecycle management CLI](../administration-guide/lifecycle-management-cli).
