# Who am I?

A frequent first troubleshooting step is validating the role assigned to an SDB is the actual role being used by your application.

Verify your identity with:

{% highlight bash %}

aws sts get-caller-identity

{% endhighlight %}

Look up your role name by curling the [meta-data endpoint](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html#instancedata-data-retrieval) for your ec2 instance:

{% highlight bash %}

curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/

{% endhighlight %}

With the role name you can get the full ARN of the role with

{% highlight bash %}

aws iam get-role --role-name <role-name>

{% endhighlight %}

# Dependency Conflicts

Another common problem is dependency conflicts.

## Java Gradle Projects

Use these commands to see the Cerberus client version that is actually being resolved in a Java Gradle project:

{% highlight bash %}

./gradlew dependencyInsight --dependency cerberus
./gradlew dependencyInsight --dependency vault
./gradlew dependencyInsight --dependency okhttp
./gradlew dependencies

{% endhighlight %}

Learn more in the [Gradle User Guide](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_management.html).

## Java Maven Projects

Debug Maven dependency conflicts using the [dependency:tree](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-dependency-plugin/examples/resolving-conflicts-using-the-dependency-tree.html) command.

# Permission Denied

#### E.g. com.nike.cpe.vault.client.VaultServerException: Response Code: 400, Messages: permission denied

The SDB you are trying to access may need permissions updated.  For example, you will get this error if the IAM
role being used isn't listed for the SDB you are trying to access (see 'Who am I?' above).

Unexpectedly, you might also see this error when the path you are trying to access doesn't exist.

Please see <a target="_blank" onclick="trackOutboundLink('https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/http/')" href="https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/http/">Vault Documentation</a> for more information on Vault errors.


# Excessive Polling

IPs making an excessive number of requests are automatically blacklisted for a configurable interval.

When using polling be sure to use a reasonable interval as determined by your organization.


# SSL Handshake Failure

#### E.g. javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Received fatal alert: handshake_failure

We've seen this during local development as result of a library conflict with the
<a target="_blank" onclick="trackOutboundLink('https://github.com/Khoulaiz/gradle-jetty-eclipse-plugin')" href="https://github.com/Khoulaiz/gradle-jetty-eclipse-plugin">jettyEclipseRun</a> Gradle plugin.  Upgrading to the
<a target="_blank" onclick="trackOutboundLink('https://github.com/akhikhl/gretty')" href="https://github.com/akhikhl/gretty">Gretty</a> plugin resolved.


# SSL Plaintext Connection Error

#### E.g. javax.net.ssl.SSLException: Unrecognized SSL message, plaintext connection?

During local development this may be due to a web proxy.  This is common in corporate environments and when working over a VPN.


# Outdated AWS SDK

#### E.g. com.amazonaws.util.EC2MetadataUtils methodname=getIAMSecurityCredentials Unable to process the credential, com.amazonaws.util.json.JSONException: Failed to instantiate class

You are probably using an older version of the AWS SDK.

### Gradle

Gradle users can see how dependencies are being resolved with the `gradle dependencies` command.

You can force a newer version by adding the following into your build.gradle

{% highlight groovy %}
// Use the newest version you can, this was current when we wrote this
final String AWS_SDK_VERSION = '1.10.5'
//noinspection GroovyAssignabilityCheck
configurations.all {
    resolutionStrategy {
        // add a dependency resolve rule
        eachDependency { DependencyResolveDetails details ->
            //Force use of certain dependencies or versions
            if (details.requested.group == 'com.amazonaws') {
                details.useVersion(AWS_SDK_VERSION)
            }
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Maven

Maven users can use the <a target="_blank" onclick="trackOutboundLink('http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-dependency-plugin/tree-mojo.html')" href="http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-dependency-plugin/tree-mojo.html">dependency tree</a>
plugin to learn more about how dependencies are being resolved.


# cerberus-token.sh

#### 301 Moved Permanently error during Auth call

This showed up when a new version of <a target="_blank" onclick="trackOutboundLink('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nike-Inc/cerberus/master/docs/user-guide/cerberus-token.sh')" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nike-Inc/cerberus/master/docs/user-guide/cerberus-token.sh">cerberus-token.sh</a> that depended on `/v2/auth/user` was used with
an old version of CMS that only implemented `/v1/auth/user`.

#### Null token during local development

This issue has showed up when an old version of <a target="_blank" onclick="trackOutboundLink('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nike-Inc/cerberus/master/docs/user-guide/cerberus-token.sh')" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nike-Inc/cerberus/master/docs/user-guide/cerberus-token.sh">cerberus-token.sh</a> was
used with a newer version of Cerberus that included Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
