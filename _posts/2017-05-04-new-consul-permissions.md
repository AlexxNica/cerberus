The latest Consul AMIs need additional permissions due to improvements in the upstart scripts.

Before deploying the latest Consul AMIs, use the CLI to update the base stack, e.g. `update-stack --stack-name base --overwrite-template`.

This can be done any time and it is safe to run this command more than once.
