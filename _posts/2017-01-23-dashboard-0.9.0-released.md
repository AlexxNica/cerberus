This release updates the "SDB Summary" page by adding additional fields and pagination.  

The "SDB Summary" page is available to admins of Cerberus and displays meta-data about SDBs (Safe
Deposit Boxes) in Cerberus including: name, description, path, owner, created by user, create 
timestamp, updated by user, updated timestamp, and permissions.  This meta data is helpful to
admins because the Dashboard enables the self-service setting up of applications and secrets. The
meta data lets an admin find out about current usage of Cerberus and who to contact about upgrades
and outages.
