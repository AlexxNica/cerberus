## Cerberus

The source code for [Nike-Inc.github.io/cerberus](http://nike-inc.github.io/cerberus)

Used to document Cerberus and its related components.

### Development
This GitHub page is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site.

To run the site locally you will need to get [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) up and running.

You should be able to do that via running `bundle install`, you will need [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) and [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) installed for that.

If your using Mac OS X and have issues with nokogiri checkout this [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37711814/error-installing-rails-on-os-x-el-capitan/39929160#39929160) answer that I found useful.

Once you have Jekyll installed you can host the site by running the following command `jekyll serve --watch`
