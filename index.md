# Cerberus

Is a complete solution that can be self hosted and allows teams to increase business agility and decrease risk by securely managing secrets like passwords and API keys as well as non-sensitive dynamic run-time properties like feature flags or logging levels.

Enables teams to manage secure properties and access control using the self-service web UI.

Enables cloud applications (running on AWS EC2 or Lambda in any AWS account) retrieve properties at run time using one of several client libraries (Java, Node, CLI).

# Cerberus is a composed system

Cerberus at a high level is a few services running in the cloud behind a router to create a single api with a web-ui for enabling self-service management of secrets and runtime properties.

Cerberus also has a CLI for managing the life cycle of a Cerberus environment, using the CLI you can go from nothing to having a VPC that hosts Cerberus with edge security.

There are several clients (Java, Node, Ruby, etc.) written for Cerberus to store and retrieve properties.
